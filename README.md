TealFleet is an idea in the making.

Goal of this project is self-hosted a web app for insight into  physical and virtual assets in small to mid size data-centers.

- Compute, storage, backup servers, ...
- Switches, firewalls, load-balancers, ...
- OS, Hypervisors, backup software , ..
- Virtual and physical appliances

The primary goal of the application is to provide users with an interface that is easy to use, offers clear visibility, and presents a well-organized overview of assets along with the associated information, such as:

- Vendor name
- Product part number and serial number
- Software versions related to that products
- Release date, end of life, end of support
- Support contracts information
- Etcâ€¦

The 'Cards' design would serve as the primary means to display this information.
