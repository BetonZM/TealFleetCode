# TealFleet - Is an idea in the making.


Goal of this project is self-hosted a web app for insight into  physical and virtual assets in small to mid size data-centers.


- Compute, storage, backup servers, ...
- Switches, firewalls, load-balancers, ...
- OS, Hypervisors, backup software , ..
- Virtual and physical appliances


It will offer users an interface designed for simplicity, ensuring easy navigation, clear visibility, and a well-structured presentation of assets. This includes providing a comprehensive overview of assets along with their relevant information, such as:

- Vendor name
- Product part number and serial number
- Software versions related to that products
- Release date, end of life, end of support
- Support contracts information
- Etcâ€¦

The 'Cards' design would serve as the primary means to display this information.
